Instructions:
wanted_distance: 100 (mm)
wanted_angle: 0 (rad)
wanted_rotation: 0 (rad)
wanted_speed: 100 (mm/s)
wanted_rotational_speed: 0 (rad/s)

Computed values:
W0: -1 (rad/s) 	 =>V0: -57 (mm/s) 	 for 91 ticks.
W1: 0 (rad/s) 	 =>V1: 0 (mm/s) 	 for 0 ticks.
W2: 1 (rad/s) 	 =>V2: 57 (mm/s) 	 for 91 ticks.

Verification:
Robot translation speed: 100 (mm/s)
Robot rotational speed: 0 (rad/s)
