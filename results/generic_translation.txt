Instructions:
wanted_distance: 100 (mm)
wanted_angle: 0.785398 (rad)
wanted_rotation: 0 (rad)
wanted_speed: 100 (mm/s)
wanted_rotational_speed: 0 (rad/s)

Computed values:
W0: 0 (rad/s) 	 =>V0: -17 (mm/s) 	 for 27 ticks.
W1: -1 (rad/s) 	 =>V1: -47 (mm/s) 	 for 75 ticks.
W2: 2 (rad/s) 	 =>V2: 64 (mm/s) 	 for 102 ticks.

Verification:
Robot translation speed: 100 (mm/s)
Robot rotational speed: 0 (rad/s)
